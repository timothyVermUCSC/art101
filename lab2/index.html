				I am Brent(he/him) and I am a second year Game Design Major from Orange
				County. It's roughly a seven hour drive from home depending on traffic, so
				you could say I'm a good distance away from what my familiar territory. I
				started programming when I was around the age of eight. I had always been
				introduced in video game design since I was a child and continued to carry
				that passion throughout my academic career.

				My name is Timothy(he/him), I am a third year Computer Science Major. I am
				orignally from San Jose, but visited Santa Cruz often as a child. I have
				been programming since Scratch came out and my Dad tricked me into learning
				to code. I spend a lot of my free time skateboarding and love music and
				cars.

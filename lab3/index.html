	<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
	<p> The purpose of this lab was to establish a good file structure and to
		create a good home page for the site</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> Since I used the template provided by Professor Modes I already had the
		neccesary file structure. In addition my previous HTML/CSS experience made
		creating the homepage a breeze</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> I feel like the homepage turned out pretty good and has a nice structure.
		You can get a look at it by clicking <a href = "../index.html">this.</a>
		As for the file structure here it is below. </p>

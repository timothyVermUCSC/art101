      <p> This Lab focused on making an api call to a daily comic and displaying
      said comic on the page.</p>

      <p> The only real challenge to this lab was that xkcd didn't allow cross
      origin requests. From what Timothy remembers from some personal projects
      CORS requests are requests that come from a url that is not the url
      that the api has specified as its origin(usual the site the api is hosted
      on). To get around this we just found a different api that accepted cors
      request to the xkcd comics.</p>

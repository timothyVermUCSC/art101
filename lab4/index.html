		<h1>Lab 4: Psuedocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Our goal in this lab was to create pseudocode for an everyday task
			as well as a task that could be completed on a computer. We chose an Oil
			Change as our everyday task because we were instructed to choose
			a an activity that most people might not be familiar with. Pong was
			a simple game that we decided could be coded fairly easily, but
			included enough steps for us to write pseudocode for.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Our biggest issue was actually comprehending what the lab was asking
			us to do. We weren&#39;t sure if Task 1 was instructing us to make a list
			of high level tasks or to select one task and psuedocode it. We eventually
			understood the assignment and brainstormed our list. We then settled
			on an Oil Change as our everyday task.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Changing Oil
						1. Drain oil
							a. Jack up Car
							b. Place oil catcher under drain plug
							c. Remove drain plug
							d. Allow to drain till empty
							e. Reinstall drain plug
						2. Replace oil filter
						3. Fill oil
							a. Add oil to cars specification
							b. Check oil level
							c. If too low add a little more
							d. Repeat steps b and c till at proper level
						4. Reset oil maintenance light
						This is our task one. We felt that writing psuedocode for an Oil
						Change was both a useful skill to learn, but also was a task that
						most people would not be familiar with. The Psuedocode for pong
						is below. We tried to be as high-level, but also as thorough as
						possible when teaching how to create Pong.</p>

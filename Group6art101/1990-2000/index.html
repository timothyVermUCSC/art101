		<p>By the 1990s, Nintendo seemed unbeatable in the console market, holding 90% of the industries’ market share. SEGA, about to release their new console the Mega Drive (Genesis in the US), wanted to take on the untouchable big N. Hiring a new CEO of SEGA of America in John Kalinski, they developed a five step plan to hopefully win over audiences. One of the first and key parts of their plan was replacing their then mascot Alex Kidd with a more suitable posterboy. Another was to make a game starring this new mascot that showcased the console’s capabilities. Sonic was to appeal to Americans and an older audience as the new kid on the block that was cooler than Mario. Kalinski argued that younger consumers love to play what they see their older peers playing, so by targeting an older audience they could theoretically hit two birds with one stone. The marketing for SEGA systems would also heavily make fun of Nintendo with slogans such as “Genesis does what Nintendon’t” and comparing the company to that of a slow moving milk truck compared to the racecar that was the Genesis. In conclusion, the strategy worked and Nintendo finally had rough competition in SEGA. 90s kids on the streets were either a Nintendo kid or a SEGA kid.</p>

    <h3>FIGHTING AND VIOLENCE</h3>

		<p>1991 would see the release of Street Fighter II, which popularized the fighting game genre. The previous installment Street Fighter, released in 1987 for arcade machines, is regarded as the first game where more than a single player can interact with each other and compete. Midway Games would introduce their version of a fighting game in 1992 with the release of Mortal Kombat. The Genesis version of the game, as a side effect of SEGA targeting an older demographic in comparison to Nintendo’s family friendly approach, allowed for the depiction of  blood and gore. This along with other games such as the SEGA-CD game Night Trap enabled concerns over violent video games. After many congressional hearings, SEGA decided to create the Video Game Rating Council in 1993 to ensure that games would be monitered and labeled accordingly based off of the contents seen in the game. This would lead to the rise of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which to this day are tasked to rate games akin to how movies and television programs are now rated.</p>

    <h3>THE 3rd DIMENSION</h3>

    <p>The 16-bit era of the early 90s had examples of allusions to the third dimensions such as the special stages of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and the high speed Super Nintendo title F-ZERO, but new advancements in technology led to developers looking into more games in the third dimension. 1993’s Star Fox, using the created Super FX chip on the Super Nintendo, and Yu Suzuki’s SEGA arcade game Virtua Fighter were two games that showcased the possibilities of 3D polygons in video games. This advancement in graphics would be a major aspect of the final years of the decade.</p>

    <h3>ALLY TURNED ENEMY</h3>

    <p>In 1991, Sony announced a partnership with Nintendo that had been going on in secret for a couple years. The idea was to create a version of the Super Nintendo with a built-in CD drive. However, Nintendo was suspicious that Sony was only partnering with them to break into the console market. Their suspicions were valid as Sony engineer Ken Kutaragi had a dream of Sony making video game consoles. Nintendo, in order to strike first before new competition was created, dropped Sony in favor of Dutch competition Phillips immediately after the announcement of the partnership. This one action led to two disasters for Nintendo. Nintendo’s betrayal would infuriate Kutaragi and Sony president Norio Ohga, leading them to creating a new division called Sony Computer Entertainment. Meanwhile, Nintendo’s console with Phillips called the CD-I was a critical and financial failure, being one of the most infamous consoles in Nintendo’s long history along with 1995’s Virtual Boy. Sony in 1994 would release the PlayStation, which combined the new advanced technologies of the industry: the CD storage and 3D graphics. They beat both Nintendo and SEGA to the punch of the sixth generation of consoles. SEGA would later release the SEGA Saturn in 1995 and Nintendo would release the Nintendo 64 in 1996. Nintendo would maintain their audience, but it was clear that Sony was a dangerous new rival. SEGA on the other hand failed to capture the public’s attention with their SEGA Saturn, leading to discussions on whether they should stay in the console business or focus on third party software. The company would try one more time with the SEGA Dreamcast, released in 1998 in Japan and 1999 for the rest of the world.</p>

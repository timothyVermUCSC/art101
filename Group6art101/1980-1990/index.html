At the time, most arcade machines were based off of war and appealed more to men. The creators made the theme instead about eating and made the character, based off of a pizza missing a slice, cute. </p>

		<p>Nintendo was a company that for lack of a better word, had an identity crisis. It went through many phases of different types of products, from card games to restaurants. They eventually found success in the games and arcade market. Early in the 1980s, they released the handheld system known as the Game and Watch, which For their next project, they originally planned for game based off of the character Popeye. However, the team was unable to secure the rights. As a result, they created their own characters for the game. The game involves Donkey Kong kidnapping the beautiful Pauline. The main protagonist they named Jumpman must climb the obstacles Donkey Kong throws at him in order to save the girl and lock the gorilla back up. The arcade game was a huge success and put Nintendo's name on the map. They would follow those releases with Donkey Kong Jr. in 1982, Mario Bros. (starring the same Jumpman from Donkey Kong, now named Mario alongside his brother Luigi) in 1983, and Punch-Out in 1984/p>

    <h3>UNIVERSAL VS NINTENDO</h3>
    <img id = "pic" src="img/universal.jpg" width="500"/>
    <div id="p">
    <p>In 1984, Universal sued Nintendo for copyright infringement. They claimed that the character and game Donkey Kong was a rip-off of the character of King Kong, which Universal claimed to owned the rights to. However, Nintendo's counsel John Kirby argued that Universal had no right threatening the small Japanese development company as King Kong was in the public domain with Universal holding no right to sue Nintendo. The verdict was a victory for Nintendo, making them more confident in being able to compete with larger American companies. Fun fact: the Nintendo character by the name of Kirby is rumored to be based off of the same John Kirby that turned the tide of the case.</p>

    <p>The Nintendo Entertainment System was just about ready to be sold to the public, but how would they get the attention of an audience that had turned their back on video games since 1983’s video game crash. The answer was a toy Robot dubbed the Robotic Operating Buddy (R.O.B.) in America. This along with other peripherals like the Nintendo Zapper that was compatible with games like Duck Hunt gave the impression to consumers that Nintendo’s products weren’t games but toys. These games plus the release of Super Mario Bros., starring the same character from the previous Nintendo games Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. made the Nintendo Entertainment System a commerical success. Nintendo would follow up this success with games such as Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Ice Climber. Other third-party developers such as Capcom and Squaresoft also found success on the NES with games such as Mega Man and Final Fantasy.</p>

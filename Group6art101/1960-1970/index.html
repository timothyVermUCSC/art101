		<h3>WHERE WAS THE INDUSTRY AT THIS POINT?</h3>

		    <p>The first sign of video games preceded this era such as Bertie the Brain and Tennis for Two in the late 1950s, but those were tech demos shown off at National Exhibitions. While they were considered marvels, they were taken apart immediately after and were dismissed as a mere yet fantastical novelty. In 1962, the first video game to be played on multiple computer installations, “Spacewar!” was invented by Steve Russell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was a space combat video game for the Programmed Data Processor-1 (PDP-1). Ralph Baer invented the first video game console in 1967 called the “Brown Box”. Baer is often referred to as the father of video games as a result. He would license his device to Magnavox who would later sell to consumers the system called the Odyssey in 1972. Though the 50s and 60s had these developments, the 1970s is known as the first official decade of the video game industry.</p>

                <p>Spacewar came out in 1962 and was one of the first video games ever. In the original two ships
                    blast each other while flying around a star. In our version you must avoid hitting the star, the corner
                    of the solar system, or the enemy ship. To win have your opponent crash and you'll pass this level.
                </p>
